# Symposium Planning

From Brandon: "talk for ten minutes informally on a panel with some folks from other institutions about the work you’re doing and your thoughts on what dh can/should be."

### Key Takeaways:
- talk for ten minutes informally
- talk about the work you’re doing
- your thoughts on what dh can/should be

## Work I'm doing
### Fall: TBTA
- Main work: taking established information architecture and layering ethical design over it
- Big lessons:
	- Hard to design for things where you can't show people's faces. Must consciously work around that.
	- The point of an archive highlighting a previously overlooked issue is to gain a wider audience. The content does the work as soon as someone is engaged, but design must get them to that point.
	- **Engaging design in a context of trauma or oppression needs to be more explicitly talked about.** A lot of the time the default for a somber subject is a somber or "inoffensive" page design, but that doesn't do justice to its subjects, because it ignores the point of creating such a resource in the first place. The point is to spread awareness and empathy; if people don't stay on the website itself, that can't happen. It's not disrespectful to the subjects of our work to address this void explicitly; it's disrespectful and dismissive to pretend that it doesn't matter. (Related example - Parkland kids saying yes, please, do "politicize" this event so that *it doesn't happen again*).
	- **Stigma around what makes us, the DH practitioners, uncomfortable should not dictate the efficacy of our mission. The politics of respectability is a tool of oppression:** we see that when we are told not to "politicize" a mass shooting; or when we are told that, in fact, college students protesting fascists are the true danger. A similar sense of "we shouldn't be tacky" leads us to not discuss the fact that visual presentation has a palpable effect on the strength and nature of people's reaction to a message. This sense is borne both out of respectability norms and out of implicit fear that those who disagree with our causes will use those norms against us. "They're strategizing about how to get people *excited* about *rape* - disgusting!" Anyone making these types of arguments are bad-faith actors, and cannot be catered to in our quest for justice and equity.

*Note: find examples of right-wing types saying this kind of thing. Bari Weiss is probably a good one, but want to get less extreme but equally insidious examples, too.*

### Spring: SLab Site
- Main work: reorganizing our content etc. and layering ethical design over it
- Big lessons:
	- Things that people talk about as petty usually aren't actually petty. They're small details that add up over time to make someone feel welcome or unwelcome in a given space, whether literal or intellectual.
	- Information architecture matters on a micro-level. Example about the Makerspace inventory.
	- Need to contact and talk with people from different backgrounds about how these spaces can give small cues that speak specifically to them - I know my perspective is limited as an educated cis white woman.

## What DH can & should be
- DH can/should use the reach of technology to tell the stories that didn't make it into textbooks.
- Medieval POC Twitter; bombing of Black Wall Street on *Freak Out & Carry On*.
- Showing, with receipts, just how much of our collective worldview must be altered before true equity is possible. It's been really difficult to realize that extremely basic assumptions that I've had about the world are entirely due to the fact that I thought it was implausible that my K12 textbooks would really leave out *so much that's really important*. What incentive would they have? How would they choose what to put in? I didn't realize how recently women and POC (etc.) had gained the power - small as still it may be - to shape the canon. There were cracks in this in the last few years for me: a conversation with my AMST advisor about the tautological implications of the discipline's first practitioners choosing arbitrarily what works were the important, defining ones of our nation. The evening of research when I learned women couldn't wear pants in the Senate until 1991. The Election. 
- I don't know when it crystallized, but at some point it clicked that the very basemost assumption I had about the world was purely and dangerously a product of its time. I was born in 1994, which meant I was in first grade in the fall of 2001. Second grade was when you learned about "world history", with textbooks printed before 9/11. That meant that our teachers taught us the "end of history" view - the USSR fell, the world is now stable and nations are asymptotically democratic & liberal - as our nation readied for a war we've yet to exit from. There is no law of physics making humans inclined toward democracy; there are only other humans and the institutions we choose to uphold.
- Given the democratic nature of information online - the "flattening" of information access - previously non-canon histories and perspectives can spread. The nature of websites means that claims can be backed up with factual receipts right there in the text. DH has a responsibility to highlight the previously non-canon; we are uniquely equipped to do so and to help such phenomena snowball beautifully.
